## Map 🗺️
I was born in Hong Kong. I'm studied in Hong Kong untill finished my undergradurate degree in The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong ([HSUHK](https://www.hsu.edu.hk/en/)). After that, I move to Hsin Chu for a master's degree. At the monment, I am studying at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University.

## Food 🍟🍖🍣
If you ask me about favourite food, what i can say is I don't know.
Foods, drinks, desserts, I love all I can eat, but I do prefer meat rather than vegitable. In such case, hotpot buffet or regular buffet is kind of a safe go to.

## Smiles 😆😄😃
In free time, I enjoy and spend time to reading novels📚, listening music🎶, gaming🎮, but most of the time I'm sleeping😴.
